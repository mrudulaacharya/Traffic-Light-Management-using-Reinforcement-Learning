## Introduction
This project is dedicated to tackling urban traffic congestion through the application of Deep Q-Learning in traffic signal control. Our goal is to create an adaptive traffic light system that responds in real-time to changing traffic conditions at a 4-way intersection, thereby enhancing traffic efficiency, reducing environmental impact, and adapting to varied traffic scenarios.

## Tools and Technologies
-Programming Language: Python

-Machine Learning Framework: Tensorflow

-Simulation Environment: SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) integrated with Traci.
